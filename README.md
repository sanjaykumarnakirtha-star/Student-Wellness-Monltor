1. Executive summary

This project delivers an Adaptive Learning Platform that ingests documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, images), processes their text via OCR and NLP, generates automated assessments (multiple-choice questions, short answers), tracks learner progress, and delivers AI-driven study recommendations. The deliverable is a web platform (frontend + backend + ML services) for learners, instructors, and administrators.

Primary differentiator: close integration of document processing, auto-assessment generation, and learner analytics to create a personalized study loop.

2. Goals & success criteria

Goals

Allow users to upload course materials and automatically extract learning units and topics.

Generate assessments automatically from documents to assess mastery.

Track learner progress at sub-topic granularity and visualize analytics.

Provide targeted study recommendations based on performance and content difficulty.

Success criteria (example measurable metrics)

90%+ of uploaded documents are successfully parsed to usable text.

Automated MCQs meet minimum quality threshold as judged by instructors (e.g., 70% acceptable).

Platform supports 1,000 concurrent learners with <200 ms median API response for read endpoints.

Recommendation relevance metric (A/B test) shows at least 10% uplift in learning session time or assessment scores.

3. Scope & assumptions

In-scope

Web frontend (React + Tailwind) for upload, review, assessment taking, analytics, and recommendations.

Backend services: file ingestion, processing orchestration, ML inference (LLM + embeddings), storage, analytics.

Assessment types: multiple-choice questions (MCQ) and short-answer prompts (auto-scored via embeddings/semantic similarity or manual grading).

Basic user accounts and role-based access (Learner, Instructor, Admin).

Out-of-scope (initial release)

Full proctoring / identity verification.

Video lecture processing or real-time tutoring.

Large-scale offline model training (we rely on managed models/APIs or precomputed embeddings).

Assumptions

You will use managed LLM/embedding APIs (OpenAI or similar) or self-hosted models if privacy requires.

Documents will be moderate size (≤ 50 pages) per upload in initial release.

Sensitive data handling must follow legal/regulatory rules (e.g., GDPR) for target markets.

4. User personas

Learner — uploads notes, studies, takes assessments, sees progress and recommendations.

Instructor — uploads course material, reviews auto-generated assessments, provides feedback, monitors class analytics.

Admin — manages users, configures system-wide settings, monitors system health and usage.

5. Features & user stories

Core features & sample user stories

Document upload & processing

As a Learner, I want to upload a PDF so the system can create practice questions from it.

Assessment generation

As an Instructor, I want to review and edit auto-generated MCQs before releasing them.

Assessment taking & scoring

As a Learner, I want to take a practice test and receive immediate feedback and a mastery score.

Progress analytics

As a Learner, I want to see my mastery per topic and study time trend.

AI-driven recommendations

As a Learner, I want study suggestions (e.g., "Review Topic X, take Quiz Y") tailored to my low-scoring topics.


6 . System architecture

High-level layers

Frontend: React (single-page app), Tailwind CSS

Backend: REST/GraphQL API (Node/Express or Python/FastAPI)

Worker/Processing: Task queue (Celery/RabbitMQ or BullMQ/Redis) for long-running jobs (OCR, embedding generation)

ML services: LLMs (question generation), embedding service (semantic search), optionally a vector DB (Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate)

Storage: Object store for files (S3), relational DB for metadata (Postgres)

Monitoring & Logs: Prometheus + Grafana, ELK stack or hosted alternative

Deployment

Containerized microservices (Docker) orchestrated with Kubernetes or Cloud Run for smaller deployments.

Export & sharing

As an Instructor, I want to export assessments to CSV or share with students.
